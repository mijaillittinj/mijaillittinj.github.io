    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This work presents an original technique based on parametric interpolation to estimate the view factor between unsteady flames and a small target. The technique was tested on a buoyant diffusion flame generated in an ethylene-fueled porous burner that emulates a pool fire. Flame images were processed to determine the flame contours in terms of parametric polynomials. A mathematical formulation based on the Stokes’ theorem was developed to estimate the view factor between the flame and a radiometer, whose contour integrals were solved numerically. These results were compared to ones obtained with the point-source method and the solid flame model, assuming the flame as a cylinder and a cone. The proposed technique captures the influence of geometry on the radiant flux field more robustly than these methods, providing estimations of thermal radiation between the point and solid flame models.</p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
    A pool fire generated with a porous burner using ethylene was analyzed with optical diagnostics to determine the flame shape and its variation with time. A mathematical formulation that converts surface integrals to con- tour integrals was developed to estimate the view factor between the flames and a radiometer. This formulation was employed by considering the true flame shape and two simplified geometries for the flame: a cylinder and a cone. The point-source model was also used for compara- tive purposes. The view factor estimated considering the true flame shape is more scattered than considering the cylindrical and conical shapes, when plotted as a function of flame height or time. Therefore, the proposed technique captures the influence of geometry on thermal radiation from the pool fire more robustly. These view factors were used along the radiant heat flux detected with a radiometer to estimate the radiation emitted by the pool fire and its radiant fraction. These magnitudes have the same trends for the three shapes considered. However, the SFM considering the simplified shapes (cylinder and cone) tends to overestimate these quantities, while the point-source model underestimates them, compared to the values re- trieved considering the true flame shape. Flame tip flickering and a characteristic pulsation frequency of ∼7 Hz confirm the oscillating nature of the pool fire studied in this work. The technique presented here offers a relatively simple and programmable method to assess the thermal radiation from a pool fire. Moreover, this method could also be applicable to turbulent flames. For this purpose, the contours for the flame sides would have to be divided into several smooth curves due to potential sharp points in the flame contours.
