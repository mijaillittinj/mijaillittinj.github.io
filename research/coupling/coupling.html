    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The implementation of an optical bench allowing the measurement of extinction and angular light scattering at different wavelengths on soot particles from a canonical flame is presented. The coupling of these optical techniques associated with the analytical theory of the RDF-FA allows an estimation of different measurands such as volume fraction, temperature and size of aggregates. A strategy for the determination of optical index based on the consideration of amorphous, graphitic and organic compounds is also presented by coupling both techniques at different wavelengths.</p>
